In this program, we define a struct called Rectangle that has two fields: width and height. We then implement two methods for the struct: area, which calculates the area of the rectangle, and fits_inside, which checks if the rectangle can fit inside another rectangle.

In the main function, we create two instances of the Rectangle struct (rect1 and rect2) and use the area and fits_inside methods to print some information about them. We then create another instance of the Rectangle struct (rect3) and use a loop to increase its size until it can fit inside rect2. Finally, we print the final size of rect3.

This program demonstrates some of the basic concepts of Rust, including structs, methods, and loops.
